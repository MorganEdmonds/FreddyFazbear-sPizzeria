# FreddyFazbear-sPizzeria Shop Capstone 

##Description 

This project is the point of sales application for FreddyFazbear-sPizzeria, a custom pizza 
shop. Currently at  FreddyFazbear-sPizzeria our customers can fully customize their pizza 
orders. Until recently we have been managing all orders in person and are 
currently taking all orders on paper. But our business is growing, and we need a 
way to automate the order process (and eventually even make it available 
online).
